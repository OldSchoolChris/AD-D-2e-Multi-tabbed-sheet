Sheet uses the API script !broll,modified to whisper rolltemplates to the GM, to simulate hidden rogue skill checks for things the player shouldn't know their character failed, keeping it a surprise!! <<evil grin>>

On the combat section, +To Hit and +Dam are for magic or special qualities fo the item itself.
Racial modifiers to combat have not been included, as I add them into custom macros I create for the players based on the combat info.
